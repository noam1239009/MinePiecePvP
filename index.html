    <!-- Removed the lower login panel -->
    <!-- Removed the Key Changes section -->

```### Key Adjustments:
1. **Removed Login Panel**: The section that included the login fields has been deleted.2. **Removed Key Changes**: Any notes or sections regarding key changes have also been removed from the HTML.3. **Maintained Structure**: The overall structure of the leaderboard is preserved, and the remaining elements are organized properly.### Next Steps:
- Ensure that you test the changes in a web browser to confirm that the login panel and key changes are no longer visible.- If you have any additional components you need to adjust or other changes to make, feel free to let me know!
